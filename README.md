# Motion-BG

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Motion BG! Motion BG is a command-line tool that I created to allow users to add animated backgrounds to their Mac devices.

The software is written in Swift and utilizes its powerful features to provide a smooth and visually appealing experience. At the moment, Motion BG only supports command-line usage, but I plan to add more functionality in the future such as GUI support, more animation options and the ability to customize the animations.

To use Motion BG, you need to have a Mac device and XCode installed, clone the repository and build the project. Once built, you can run Motion BG from the command line by providing the path to the desired animation, and set it as your Mac's background.

Please note that Motion BG is currently in development and may contain bugs or unfinished features. I welcome any feedback or contributions to the project. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for new features, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

Thank you for using Motion BG and enjoy your new animated background!
